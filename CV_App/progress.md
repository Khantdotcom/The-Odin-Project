1. I took almost 2 hours figuring out how to render a list of inputs, which is a pretty basic thing. 
2. The thing about me learning from articles, tutorials is that i don't really understand a function or a usecase
3. This project is fairly simple.
4. I will try understanding deep meaning behind EVERYTHING.
