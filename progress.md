- I would take 2 weeks of hiatus sacrificed for SAT exam.
- I am now just editing since for keeping green on my github stats page.
- November 2th onwards, I'm gonna be committing meaningfully. 

November 10- I have to go back to basics everytime i need to recall some function/attributes. One mistake is that when i read documentation, i perpentually leave things without practice, without challenging knowledge. I'm like " ohh they are so basic, understandable, i can move on to the more advanced concepts"

1. I don't recognize the stage I really understand something deep down, "what's like to fully understand something?"
    - if you can ultizie something?
    - if you can recall facts?
    - or if you can corelate with other concepts?
2. I move on quickly without any reflection

november 10 18:25- i feel like i'm making no progress after 5 absolute days of learning web dev(before sat+ after)

1. things about my planning - i just plan, i don't plan how that plan will be executed HOW>. 

Action Plans

- disconnected for a while and now iâ€™m back from afk
